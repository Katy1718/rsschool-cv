### About me
For the last year I have been working at a large IT company, Yandex, in the advertising department. During this time, I acquired the necessary soft skills and an understanding of the productive work system. 
I have also always been interested in web design and web programming. Since 2019, I have been creating custom websites as a freelancer. 
Now I have decided to take it to the next level and am studying the technologies necessary to work as a front-end developer.
